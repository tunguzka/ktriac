**********************

Compile:
make

Usage:
The ramp utility helps you to turn on/off the triac gradully, you can specify ramps according your needs.

The general form to specify a ramp:
./ramp [from%]-[to%]-[step%]-[time in ms]

in [time] will change the triac power [from%] to [to%] increasing/decreasing with [step%]

Example:
./ramp 0%-60%-5%-1000 > /sys/ktriac/ktriac
this command turns on in 1000m (1 sec) the triac starting from 0% increasinc the power with 5% in every step until reaching 60%.

You can specify many ramps in a command:
./ramp 0%-60%-5%-2000 60%-100%-1%-1000 100%-0%-1%-500 > /sys/ktriac/ktriac

Will trun on in two steps 0% -> 60% in 2000ms and from 60% -> 100% in 1000 ms after this turn off gradually in 500 ms.
